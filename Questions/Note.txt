Few Important Questions solved so far, approach I used.
Ques 1:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/multiply-two-strings/1

Given the constraints (strings of size 1 to 10^3) and the requirement to multiply them, using BigInteger is indeed the correct and most robust approach. It avoids the overflow issues that would inevitably arise with int or long.

My approach: finding each digit or negative character "-" and constructing the integer but it needs to be adapted to use BigInteger methods for calculations
and pass test cases at GFG.
