Selection Sort:
Can be optimized with less variables I used in my code.
With inner loop start index set equal to outer loop index.
Time Complexity is O(N**2) in all cases (Worst, Best, Average).

Bubble Sort:
Can be optimized with a boolean is_sorted check!
so that if input array is already sorted, it returns early with O(N) time complexity.
Otherwise the actual Time Complexity is O(N**2) only.
